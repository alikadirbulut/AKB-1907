# AKB-1907
Robot car

I have been conducting this projet for my own seek to improve my programming skills.
If you are Interested in the details of my project, I can share the source codes with you. 
You can see the outline from here : https://github.com/alikadirbulut/AKB-1907/blob/main/outline.pdf
You can have an idea about the car watcching the video from this link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhWfG-QcBfo
This projectis still on progress ,so I would like to say It is going to take a while to implement all the features to the car.
